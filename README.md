This repo contains the Jupyter Notebooks and data files used in this presentation. Sorry, but I was not particularly careful with the provenance of the data, but it all comes from public data sources. (I stole it fair and square!)

Please note that I am not a statistician. I am a programmer and database developer. I have automated quite a number of datacentric tasks, but I am not qualified to interpret the results.
